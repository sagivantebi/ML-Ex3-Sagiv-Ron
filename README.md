# **Extending Chapter 11: Two-Hidden-Layer MLP for MNIST**

This repository contains an extended version of the original single-hidden-layer MLP code from Chapter 11 of the book [_Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn_ by Raschka et al. (2022)_](https://github.com/rasbt/machine-learning-book/blob/main/ch11/ch11.ipynb). The code has been revised to include **two hidden layers** from scratch, and another one using Keras. Additionally, the final performance (macro AUC) is compared with:

1. The **original single-hidden-layer**  
2. The **extended two-hidden-layer**
3. A **fully connected ANN** implemented in **Keras**.
